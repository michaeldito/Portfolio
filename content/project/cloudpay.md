This was my final project for Cloud Systems Architecture. As a group, we had to to design our project from scratch, and figure out what architectural components we needed. In short we took advantage of services that the Google Cloud Platform had to offer like load balancing, auto scaling, pub/sub, and their cloud spanner database. Custom components we built included a Flask REST server, a translator server, a delivery server, and an accruals server. For more details on the project, check out our powerpoint and our git repository!
