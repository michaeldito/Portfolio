A great Node.js course I found on Udemy. I had been exposed to Node previously in our Database course at Sonoma, but I wanted to dig a little more into it. This course covers the following topics:

- Node.js Fundamentals  
- Asynchronous Node.js  
- Web Servers with Express  
- Middleware  
- Testing with Mocha  
- MongoDB, Mongoose, and REST APIs  
- Security and Authentication  
- Real Time Apps with Socket.io
- Async/Await  

I'm still currently working through this course, I hope to finish it soon.
