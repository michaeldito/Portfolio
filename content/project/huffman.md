The Huffman compression algorithm implemented in Python. This was my final
project for my Analysis of Algorithms class. In addition to learning the
compression algorithm, I decided to explore the popular data science library 
Pandas for this project. It's dataframe data structure provided a really nice
way to print out a table of data.
