This is a personal project that really helped me solidify the fundamentals of programming. I started it over winter break after completing Programming II in C++, and it required an understanding of each concept we discussed in that class: variables, conditionals, loops, basic data structures, file input/output, classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. Before I began coding, I first mapped out on paper the logic needed for it. This made implementing the project go pretty smooth. But, I still ran into issues when implementing it as things came up I hadn't mapped out. Which taught me a good lesson, you can never spend too much time mapping out your project before you dive in. In the end, this project taught me a lot about the importance writing up specifications, and how to plan out a program's logic before diving into the code.

After getting exposed to Node.js, and taking Database Management Systems Design at Sonoma, I decided to recreate this project as a web application.
