This is another course I found on Udemy. I'm currently still working through it, along with the Pro MERN Stack book I picked up. It has sections on the following topics:

- Introduction to React  
- Ajax Requests with React  
- Modeling Application State  
- Managing App State with Redux  
- Redux Middleware  
- React Router and Redux Form  

I hope to finish this course soon, when I have time between my school work load.
