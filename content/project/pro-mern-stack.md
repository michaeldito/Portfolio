I found this book when I began looking into React. I thought this book would nicely complement my previous experience with Node.js, and provide practice using MongoDB and Express.

The book covers many tools that go into building a modern web application:

- React Router  
- React Bootstrap  
- Redux  
- Babel  
- ES Lint  
- Webpack  
- Express  
- MongoDB  

I'm still currently working through it, and I hope to finish when my school workload decreases.
