This assignment was the first step in building up the skills needed to parse a JSON object. In this phase, we were only interested in parsing the linearly nested lists with a provided lexical analyzer, and determining whether the list was properly formed or not. The goals of this assignment were to continue to practice recursion, learn how to use and modify a lexical analyzer, and parse linearly nested lists. In the end, just as in the Recursive Lists project, the solution was achieved by careful analysis of the data structure, and with very carefully thought out if statements. The end result, we are one step closer to building a JSON parser!
