This is another course I found on Udemy. I already knew a bit of Python, but I wanted to learn more. It coverts the following topics:

- Flask Web Applications  
- Tkinter Desktop Applications  
- SQlite 3 Database Applications  
- Beautiful Soup Webscraping  
- Web Mapping with Folium  
- Data Analysis with Pandas  
- Interactive Web Visualization with Bokeh  
- Computer Vision for Image and Video Processing with OpenCV  
- Object Oriented Programming  

I've made my way through most of the course, but their are a few sections I would like to do when I have the time.
