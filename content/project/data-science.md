I've started a Data Science course on Udemy to learn some powerful Python libraries such as:  
 
- NumPy   
- Pandas   
- Matplotlib   
- Seaborn   
- Plotly   
- Cufflinks   

There is also a section on Machine Learning, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Big Data, 
Spark, and so much more. I'm hoping to finish it very soon.
