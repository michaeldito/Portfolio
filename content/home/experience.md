### Sonoma State University  
#### Assistant Student Instructor (Fall 2017) 
As an ASI for our Discrete Structures for Computer Science course at SSU I held multiple study sessions every week to help students practice the material. Along with the other ASI's I would help draft up practice worksheets, and I would also teach students how to debug their C++ code.  

### Sonoma State University   
#### Student Assistant (Fall 2017)
As a Student Assistant for our Data Structures course I was responsible for grading labs and projects, and providing students with feedback about their code.

### iD Tech Camps (Sonoma, San Anselmo, UC Berkeley)
#### Director (Summer 2017)
Over the summer I directed three separate iD Tech summer camps where kids would come to learn how to program, design video games, make their first website, and much more. I was responsible for the safety and well-being of campers, managing camp logistics/inventory, and employee timekeeping. With my team of 3-4 instructors, we tried to spark the internal drive of technology in each camper. After each week I would draft plans to improve the camp experience, and throughout the summer I would provide instructors with feedback and opportunities for growth.

#### Client Service Representative (Summer 2014 - Fall 2016)
