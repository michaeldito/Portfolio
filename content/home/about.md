# Biography

I'm a Computer Science student at Sonoma State University with just a few semesters left (expected graduation - December 2018). Right now I work as an Assistant Student Instructor for our Discrete Mathematics class, and I am a Student Assistant for our Data Structures class. These jobs allow me to do what I enjoy: *learn, teach, problem-solve, and code.* My goals for my software career are to become a Software Engineer and a Project Manager. I'm currently searching for my first software internship for the summer of 2018. I'm hoping to find one in Software Engineering or Project Management, or any position which allows me to contribute as a member of a software team. In my spare time I like to find interesting Udemy courses, play disc golf, hike, run, and play some games with my friends.
