# Biography

I'm a Computer Science student at Sonoma State University, with just a few semesters left (expected graduation - December 2018). Right now I work as an Assistant Student Instructor for our Discrete Mathematics class, and I am a grader for our Data Structures class. These jobs allow me to do what I enjoy: *learn, teach, problem-solve, and code.* My goal for my software career is to become a Cloud Engineer. I'm currently searching for my first software internship for the summer of 2018. I'm hoping to find one in DevOps, QA, or any position which leverages my skills - writing clean, well documented, and well tested code, and being a good team member.
