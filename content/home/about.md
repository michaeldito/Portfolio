# Biography

I'm a Computer Science student at Sonoma State University, currently enrolled in computer architecture, cloud systems architecture, analysis of algorithms, and software design and development. My interests are in the areas of cloud computing, and full stack web application development. Right now I work as an Assistant Student Instructor for our Discrete Mathematics class, as well as a grader for our Data Structures class. These jobs and my interests allow me to do what I enjoy most: *teach, problem solve, and code.*
